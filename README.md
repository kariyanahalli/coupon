## User Attribute Analysis

In this analysis I analysed who is likely to accept the coupons

- Age Group
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Income group

## Complex behaviorial and user attribute interactions

For e.g., : Drivers - going to bars frequently, and not traveling with children, and not being in  rural or fishing occupations — are significantly more likely to accept bar coupons.

## Contextual Attribute based interaction

Acceptance Rate based on Passenger type

## User Atrribute correlation against other User Attribute correlation

No clear indications.

## Summary

In conclusion this effort I achieved 

- Tried understanding user behavior based on demographics, habits and context
- Visualize acceptance rate across various groups
- Identify patterns in who accepts which type of coupons
- User correlation analysis and conditional logic to find key predictors of coupon acceptance.
